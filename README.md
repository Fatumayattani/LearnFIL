## Overview

LearnFIL breaks down complex Filecoin concepts into bite-sized interactive modules with real coding sandboxes. By making Filecoin accessible to students, builders, and hackathon teams, LearnFIL lowers the barrier to entry and helps grow a knowledgeable, active community.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Code Sandbox** - Write and execute code directly in your browser with instant feedback
- **Structured Curriculum** - Progressive learning path from CIDs to FVM smart contracts
- **Progress Tracking** - Visual indicators and completion tracking for every lesson
- **Hands-On Learning** - Every lesson includes practical coding exercises
- **Beginner Friendly** - No prior Filecoin experience required
- **100% Free** - All content is freely accessible forever

## Curriculum

LearnFIL offers a comprehensive, production-ready curriculum designed to take developers from zero to shipping Filecoin applications. Our hands-on approach ensures every concept is reinforced through interactive coding exercises.

### Module 1: Understanding CIDs
**Master content addressing and cryptographic identifiers**

Dive deep into Content Identifiers (CIDs), the foundation of Filecoin's data architecture. Learn how content addressing enables verifiable, permanent, and tamper-proof data storage.

Topics covered:
- What is a CID and why it matters
- CID versions (v0 vs v1) and their use cases
- Multibase, multicodec, and multihash explained
- Creating and validating CIDs
- Content addressing vs location addressing
- Practical applications in decentralized storage

### Module 2: Storage Deals
**Navigate the complete storage deal lifecycle**

Master the economics and mechanics of storage deals on Filecoin. Understand how to negotiate, monitor, and manage storage agreements with storage providers.

Topics covered:
- Storage deal fundamentals and terminology
- Deal proposal and acceptance flow
- Pricing strategies and cost calculation
- Data transfer and sealing process
- Provider collateral and penalties
- Deal duration and renewal
- Verifying deal status and provider reputation
- Retrieval deals and data access
- Best practices for production storage

### Module 3: FVM Smart Contracts
**Build programmable storage applications**

Unlock the power of the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) to create smart contracts that interact with storage primitives. Deploy EVM-compatible contracts and build data-driven applications.

Topics covered:
- Introduction to FVM architecture
- EVM compatibility and Solidity support
- Deploying your first smart contract
- Interacting with Filecoin built-in actors
- Storage bounties and programmable deals
- Data DAOs and decentralized governance

- Testing and debugging FVM contracts
- Production deployment strategies

### Module 4: IPFS and Filecoin Integration
**Connect content addressing with permanent storage**

Learn how IPFS and Filecoin work together to provide both fast retrieval and long-term archival storage. Build applications that leverage both protocols.

Topics covered:
- IPFS fundamentals and architecture
- Content routing and DHT
- Pinning services and persistence
- Bridging IPFS to Filecoin
- Hybrid storage strategies
- NFT storage and metadata
- Building with web3.storage
- Performance optimization

### Module 5: Retrieval and Data Access
**Efficient data retrieval patterns**

Master the retrieval market and learn strategies for fast, cost-effective data access from the Filecoin network.

Topics covered:
- Retrieval deal mechanics
- Payment channels and micropayments
- Saturn CDN integration
- Caching strategies
- GraphSync protocol
- Retrieval provider selection
- Performance optimization
- Building retrieval applications

### Module 6: Storage Proofs and Verification
**Understand cryptographic guarantees**

Deep dive into the cryptographic proofs that make Filecoin trustless and verifiable. Learn how Proof-of-Replication and Proof-of-Spacetime work.

Topics covered:
- Proof-of-Replication (PoRep) explained
- Proof-of-Spacetime (PoSt) mechanics
- Sealing and verification process
- WindowPoSt and WinningPoSt
- Sector lifecycle management
- Slashing conditions and penalties
- Verifying storage proofs programmatically
- Zero-knowledge proofs in Filecoin

### Module 7: Building Production Applications
**Deploy real-world Filecoin dApps**

Put everything together to build, test, and deploy production-grade applications on Filecoin. Learn best practices, tooling, and deployment strategies.

Topics covered:
- Application architecture patterns
- Client library selection (js-filecoin-client, lotus API)
- Wallet integration and transaction signing
- User experience best practices
- Error handling and retry logic
- Monitoring and observability
- Cost optimization strategies
- Security best practices
- Testing and CI/CD
- Production deployment checklist

### Coming Soon

- **Module 9**: Filecoin Economics - Token mechanics, mining, and network incentives
- **Module 10**: Storage Provider Operations - Running your own storage node

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Icons**: Lucide React

- **Code Execution**: In-browser JavaScript evaluation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account (for database)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/learnfil.git
cd learnfil
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
# Copy .env file and add your Supabase credentials
